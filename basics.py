# this is the print statement to print something on screen
print("hellow world")

# this is how we use variable in python
# python is dynamically typed language so we do not define the type of variable  

# this is varibale of integer
integer = 3
# this is variable of string 
string = "string"
# this is variable of float
float = 39.4

print(float)

# and so on we can make any varibale without writting the type of variable 

# list 
list = [3,5,"name"]

# dictionaries

dict = {
    "nam": "zuhaib",
    "age": 20, 
}
print(dict)
